####	Back-propagation network format training data

The data in this archive is formatting in both a "raw"
form (a table with input columns and a single label
column), as well as in "bpformat", in which each label
column value has been given its own 0/1 valued column
in the output.

No other processing has been done (for example, input
values have not been normalized into any range).

Training and testing data has been provided.
